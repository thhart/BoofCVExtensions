# BoofCVExtensions

This is a incubator space for concepts, patterns, ideas and extensions to BoofCV
which might be merged into BoofCV later or never.

This repository is in early stage design and might change dramatically,
whoever is interested in contributing don't hesitate to contact and I can give access to it.

## Helper

This area contains some helpers which might be useful for your development with BoofCV.

## Personal space

If you want to contribute and you feel unsure please use the personal package
tree, the personal tree has a very low threshold for commits and might even change
without further notice. Dependencies to personal space should be avoided as best as
possible.
